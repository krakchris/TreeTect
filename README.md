# Introduction

Green City Watch is a geospatial AI firm specializing in urban ecological engineering. We build greener, smarter cities by leveraging Industry 4.0 technology to empower municipalities and local councils with data-driven urban ecology.   

After learning that urban trees live just 13 years, while their rural counterparts live up to 100 or more, Green City Watch was born. We leverage a combination of ecological engineering, machine learning techniques, and remote sensing methods, known as "geospatial AI", to boost urban tree longevity. 

Green City Watch empowers 30+ (mega)cities, from Boston to Amsterdam to Jakarta, to understand, monitor, and improve their urban forests through data-driven decision-making.
